SECTION 1
The purpose of this app

SECTION 2
Currently, this app allows users to add or delete events, add an event category, and assign an event category to an event.

SECTION 3
Future improvements include adding a Person class to hold necessary info about users of the app. To achieve this, we will need to create a form that obtains essential contact information. To identify individual users, a user ID will be generated for each event participant.
